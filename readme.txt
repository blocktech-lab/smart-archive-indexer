Display indexes by dates (years, months, and days archives), authors, and taxonomy terms for quick navigation and filtering of posts.

== Description ==
The plugin displays indexes based on date archives (years, months, and days), authors, and taxonomy terms, facilitating quick navigation and post filtering. It offers extensive customization options for each shortcode or block used.

The plugin utilizes shortcodes to generate archive indexes. There are three distinct shortcodes, each equipped with various attributes for index configuration and styling. Additionally, the plugin integrates three Gutenberg Block Editor blocks, each configurable through the Block Sidebar.

All blocks are accessible under the 'Smart Archive Indexer' block category.
